# Consuming a Component

Toga Components rely on NOTHS [Styles-Toolkit](https://github.com/notonthehighstreet/styles-toolkit) to get the core styles.
The Styles-Toolkit CSS file must be included in your project.

To render a component, the CSS, JavaScript and HTML must be pulled into your app.
We have an example node app doing this for :

 * [one component](example/routes/one-component.js)
 * [multiple components](example/routes/multiple-components.js)
